Analysis of Blue Bike data in the Boston Region since 2015

Welcome to the Bluebike Analysis and Data Visualizations


The Bluebike data being analyzed on this page is from Bluebike public system data.

Bluebike has already pre-preformed data cleansing on the data sets they published. These include removing trips taken by staff as they service the bikes and/or the stations. Additionally, they cleansed trips lasting less than 60 seconds to remove potential false starts and re-docking attempts.

Data analysis and visualizations were done using the Qlik Sense Cloud Analytics framework.

This webpage showing the data analysis and visualizations of Bluebike data has been done as a personal project by Brooke Potvin. The webpage development uses a Flask environment written using Python. User data information is stored using an SQL database system, with passwords protected using a hash sequence.
