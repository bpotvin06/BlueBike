    <h1>This is the year 2018</h1>

    <h5>Based on this chart we are able to see the rides for the year 2018 broken down by month.</h5>
    <h5>Clearly, the summer and warm months have a larger amount of rides then in the winter.</h5>
    <h5>January recorded the least rides (40.93k) and July is recorded having the most rides (242.92k).</h5>
    <h5>Therefore, we can see an increase of 493.5% from January to July in total rides per month.</h5>
    <h5>The mass expansion in Bluebike usage is largely due to adding stations into neighborhoods: Somerville, Brookline, Roxbury, Dorchester and more in the Boston area.</h5>
    <br>
    <img logo src="{{ url_for('static', filename='UserType4.png' )}}" class="center" />
    <h5>Bluebike categories users by two types, Customer and Subscriber.</h5>
    <h5>A Subscriber has a monthly or annual membership while a Customer is a single use ride.</h5>
    <h5>For the first time we notice the proportion of Customers growing from the previous year (by 2.8%).</h5>
    <br>
    <img logo src="{{ url_for('static', filename='TripDurationUser4.png' )}}" class="center" />
    <h5>When looking at the average trip during (in seconds) by user type, Subscribers remain more consistant in trip duration than Customers.</h5>
    <h5>The average trip duration for Customers is 4,420.83 seconds (or 1.228 hours) and the average trip duration for Subscribers is 885.12 seconds (or 14.75 minutes).</h5>
    <h5>The most signicant outlier in this analysis can be seen in the Customers during October. Without this outlier, customers average trip duration would be 4,115.45 seconds 
        (or 1.143 hours). Including the outlying October data increases customers average trip duration by 7.42%.</h5>

    <h5>The top 5 annually most started from Bluebike stations are indicated in this graph, along with their corresponding Subscriber and User amounts.</h5>
    <h5>The most popular station is (again) at MIT with 53,850 rides in 2018. Noting  for the third year in a row this is the most popular station.</h5>
    <h5>Subscibers with memberships account for 90.36% of all rides at the top 5 most used starting stations.</h5>
    <br>
    <img logo src="{{ url_for('static', filename='Top5End4.png' )}}" class="center" />
    <h5>The top 5 annually most ending from Bluebike stations are indicated in this graph, along with their corresponding Subscriber and User amounts.</h5>
    <h5>The most popular station is at MIT with 49,630 rides ending there. 
        Including the other MIT station listed in the top 5, these top 2 stations alone account for 5.43% of the total rides in 2018.</h5>
    <h5>Consistently, we still see the majority of riders ending at the top 5 finishing stations are Subscribers, accounting for 89.66% of the rides.</h5>
    <br>
    <img logo src="{{ url_for('static', filename='Boxplot4.png' )}}" class="center" />
    <h5>The median amount of rides that finish at an ending station is 1,950 with first and third quartiles having 340 and 8,480 rides respectively.
        Though the median value has decreased since the previous year, the first and third quartile values have increased.</h5>
    <h5>This year, we can see the most amount of stations being considered outliers, 12 in total, showing they are significantly used more frequently.</h5>
    <h5>Considering this large disparity, having these most used stations be maintained properly is vital to the success of Bluebike due to their popularity.</h5>
    <br>
    <img logo src="{{ url_for('static', filename='GenderUserAmount4.png' )}}" class="center" />
    <h5>Gender is indicated in this graph by 1 = Male, 2 = Female, 0 = No response.</h5>
    <h5>This year, we notice the return of some Customers reporting gender, but the majority (65.38%) did not report. </h5>
    <h5>Subscribers continue to be male dominated, being 74.31% of their riders. Female subscribers making up 24.93% of riders and non-responding subscribers account for 0.76%.</h5>
    <h5>Continuously we see the trend of Bluebike riders being heavily male-dominated.</h5>
    <br>
    <img logo src="{{ url_for('static', filename='BirthYearAmount4.png' )}}" class="center" />
    <h5>Users of Bluebike have the ability to report their birth year. For only 9,592 of the rides (0.54%) birth year was not reported.</h5>
    <h5>Interestingly enough there is found to be a spike in riders born in 1969, 223,657 riders in total making up 12.65% of rides. 
        Either this is truly a spike in an age demographic joining Bluebike (they would have been 49 years old in 2018), or this is due to false reporting by users.</h5>
    <h5>Besides that outlier, the most amount of rides were found to have been taken by respondents born in 1992, making them 26 in 2018.</h5>
