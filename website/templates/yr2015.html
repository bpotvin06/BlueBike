    <h5>Based on this chart we are able to see the rides for the year 2015 broken down by month.</h5>
    <h5>Clearly, the summer and warm months have a larger amount of rides then in the winter.</h5>
    <h5>February recorded the least rides (4.02k) and July is recorded having the most rides (175.32k).</h5>
    <h5>Therefore, we can see an increase of 4,261% from February to July in total rides per month.</h5>

    <h5>Bluebike categories users by two types, Customer and Subscriber.</h5>
    <h5>A Subscriber has a monthly or annual membership while a Customer is a single use ride.</h5>
    <h5>In 2015, Subscribers make up 67% of total rides while Customers make up 33% of rides. </h5>

    <img logo src="{{ url_for('static', filename='AvgTripUser.png' )}}" class="center" />
    <h5>When looking at the average trip during (in seconds) by user type, we notice a significant outlier in Customers during March.</h5>
    <h5>These outlying customers had an average trip of 5,960 seconds (or 1.65 hours).</h5>
    <h5>While Bluebike has not documented any significant changes for March of 2015, we know that all Bluebikes (called Hubway at the time) came out of "hibernation" by early April 2015.</h5>
    <h5>Along with late March being the beginning of spring after the snowiest winter Boston has seen since 1995, we may conclude that a mass emergence of bikes emerged prior in March leading to this larger outlier of average trip duration.</h5>
    <h5>Additionally, by looking at the data another trend emerges, of all Subscriber ride averages being below 2,700 seconds.</h5>
    <h5>This is due to Subscribers membership restrictions allowing a maximum of 2,700 seconds (45 minutes) per ride without additional charges.</h5>
